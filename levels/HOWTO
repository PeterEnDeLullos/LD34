The engine mostly doesn't give a fuck about what you do as an artist. However, a few layers are compulsory:

1. Objects - this layer contains data of objects. The object type is defined by the type property in TILED, NOT by the image. Permitted are at the moment:
-- chest (small c)
---- Object properties are used to give loot (Not yet implemented; no items are implemented as of yet)
-- lever (small l)
---- Object property left, right, up, down is used for level shifts (not yet implemented)

2. Enemies
-- not yet implemented; not yet compulsory but WILL be compulsory

3. Doors - This layer contains objects which define the position of the doors. Again, the image isn't used at all, but the NAME is used to define direction.
-- The engine expects at max four objects: objects named left, right, up, down

4. col - 
-- This layer contains ONLY polylines, nothing else. Use something else and the engine crashes! Naming isn't important (isn't used at all)

5. foreground -- this layer is NOT compulsory, but this layer will be rendered above the player.

All other layers will just be rendered and ignored.
